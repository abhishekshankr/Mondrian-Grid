Mondrian Grid Generator is a Figma plugin designed to facilitate the creation of Mondrian-style geometric patterns.

It offers a set of controls for users to specify parameters such as grid levels, stroke thickness, and the ratio of cell division, enabling a wide range of design possibilities. The plugin produces a randomized, unique output within the user-specified constraints. It's particularly useful for designers seeking to quickly generate abstract, geometrically-structured artwork or backgrounds, in line with Mondrian's distinctive style, directly within their Figma projects.

<h2>How to Use</h2>

To use the plugin, select a frame and set the parameters. Increasing the levels parameter increases the number of cells in the grid. Stroke controls the thickness of the stroke and the split ratio slider lets you define how even you want the randomized cell division to occur.

Choosing a levels value of 2 can create distinct grids to use in presentation slides.

<b>NOTE: Select an empty frame to run the plugin as it will remove all children objects present in the frame<b>
